# Engagement Tracking

This folder represents engagement and feedback logic used to measure GTM performance beyond basic open or click metrics.

Business goals of this subsystem:
- Capture and interpret engagement signals from personalized assets
- Measure depth of interaction (e.g. video watch percentage)
- Feed engagement data back into operational workflows
- Enable prioritization and iteration based on real prospect behavior

This subsystem closed the loop between GTM execution and decision-making.
