# Distribution

This folder represents automated distribution logic used to deliver personalized GTM assets into outbound and operational workflows.

Business goals of this subsystem:
- Route rendered assets into outreach and campaign tools
- Trigger downstream automations via webhooks and integrations
- Eliminate manual upload and campaign setup steps
- Ensure reliable handoff between production and execution

This subsystem connects asset production directly to GTM execution.
