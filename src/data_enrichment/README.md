# Data Enrichment

This folder contains representative scripts related to prospect and account data enrichment used in GTM workflows.

Business goals of this subsystem:
- Normalize and clean inbound prospect data
- Enrich company and domain metadata
- Prepare structured inputs for downstream personalization and media generation
- Reduce manual research time for sales and GTM teams

These scripts illustrate how enrichment logic was automated and scaled as part of a larger GTM system.
