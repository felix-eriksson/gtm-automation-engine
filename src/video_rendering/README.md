# Video Rendering

This folder represents automated video rendering and orchestration used for personalized GTM outreach.

Business goals of this subsystem:
- Render prospect-specific videos at scale using dynamic inputs
- Combine personalized media assets, AI-generated voice, and templates
- Automate batch production of hundreds or thousands of videos
- Eliminate manual editing while preserving high-quality output

This subsystem allowed personalized video outreach to operate as a scalable GTM channel rather than a manual creative process.
